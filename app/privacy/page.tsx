              <h2><span>1.</span> Information We Collect</h2>
              <p>Dibs collects information needed to operate the marketplace and provide the services you ask for.</p>
              <p>Depending on how you use Dibs, this may include:</p>
              <h3>Phone number and account information</h3>
              <p>When you sign up through the Dibs website or use Dibs through iMessage, we may collect your phone number in international format or an iMessage email address.</p>
              <p>For web accounts, Dibs may also collect information such as your name, email address, city or Miami-area location, account timestamps, internal account identifiers, acquisition source, and related account information.</p>
              <p>For iMessage users, Dibs may collect your phone number or iMessage email address, conversation-space information, internal user identifiers, onboarding status, onboarding timestamps, and messaging-provider identifiers.</p>
              <h3>Messages and conversations</h3>
              <p>Dibs stores messages exchanged with Dibs and, where applicable, messages exchanged between buyers and sellers through Dibs.</p>
              <p>This can include:</p>
              <ul><li>messages you send to Dibs</li><li>Dibs-generated responses</li><li>buyer and seller messages</li><li>relayed messages</li><li>timestamps</li><li>message identifiers</li><li>conversation associations</li><li>AI conversation history</li><li>AI tool results and assistant responses</li></ul>
              <p>Your messages may contain information that you choose to provide.</p>
              <h3>Marketplace listings</h3>
              <p>If you use Dibs to sell something, Dibs may collect information about the item, including:</p>
              <ul><li>title</li><li>description</li><li>price</li><li>condition</li><li>category</li><li>city or area</li><li>photos</li><li>item details such as size, dimensions, material, defects, included items, or packaging information when you provide them</li><li>listing status and timestamps</li></ul>
              <p>Photos uploaded to Dibs are stored as provided. Photos may contain metadata embedded in the original file, including metadata that could potentially contain device or location information.</p>
              <h3>Public listing information</h3>
              <p>When you publish a listing, information such as the listing title, description, price, condition, city or area, photos, and listing status may be publicly visible.</p>
              <p>Public listing pages do not expose your phone number or email address.</p>
              <p>Dibs may also include listing information and the first listing photo in social-sharing previews.</p>
              <h3>Searches and requests</h3>
              <p>When you use Dibs through the website, Dibs receives the natural-language request you submit. This may include the product you want, a budget, a city or area, or anything else you choose to include.</p>
              <p>Ordinary web search requests are not explicitly saved to Dibs&apos; database as search-history records.</p>
              <p>Requests sent through iMessage are different: they become part of your Dibs conversation history and may be processed by Dibs&apos; AI systems.</p>
              <h3>Deal information</h3>
              <p>Dibs does not process payments.</p>
              <p>However, when buyers and sellers interact through Dibs, Dibs may store information associated with marketplace activity, such as:</p>
              <ul><li>buyer and seller identifiers</li><li>listing and conversation identifiers</li><li>agreed prices</li><li>descriptions of what happened</li><li>deal status</li><li>confidence information</li><li>timestamps</li><li>evidence derived from messages</li></ul>
              <p>Dibs may automatically analyze messages for signals suggesting that a deal may have occurred.</p>
              <h3>Payment information</h3>
              <p>Dibs does not currently collect:</p>
              <ul><li>credit or debit card numbers</li><li>bank account details</li><li>payment credentials</li><li>in-app payment transaction records</li></ul>
              <p>Buyers and sellers arrange payment and meetups themselves.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="how-we-use-information">
              <h2><span>2.</span> How We Use Information</h2>
              <p>We use information to operate Dibs and provide the marketplace experience you ask for.</p><p>This includes:</p>
              <ul><li>sending and receiving messages</li><li>responding to requests</li><li>helping you find products</li><li>helping you sell products</li><li>understanding your requests</li><li>showing relevant marketplace information</li><li>helping buyers and sellers communicate</li><li>operating listings and conversations</li><li>detecting potential marketplace activity</li><li>preventing abuse and misuse</li><li>maintaining and troubleshooting the service</li><li>improving Dibs</li></ul>
              <p>For example, if you text Dibs:</p><blockquote>“find me a PS5 under $300”</blockquote>
              <p>Dibs may process that message to understand what you want and return relevant marketplace information.</p>
              <p>If you send Dibs a photo of something you want to sell, Dibs may process the image and accompanying information to understand what you are selling and help you create or manage a listing.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="ai-processing">
              <h2><span>3.</span> AI Processing</h2><p>AI is a core part of Dibs.</p>
              <p>Dibs uses OpenAI to process certain information needed to understand requests, search marketplace information, generate responses, and make contextual product decisions.</p>
              <p>Depending on the interaction, information sent to OpenAI may include:</p>
              <ul><li>the current message</li><li>recent conversation history</li><li>previous assistant messages</li><li>tool results</li><li>listing titles and descriptions</li><li>prices</li><li>cities</li><li>item conditions</li><li>listing status</li><li>marketplace search results</li><li>seller draft information</li><li>information used to evaluate whether a follow-up message is appropriate</li></ul>
              <p>Dibs does not intentionally include your phone number, email address, or name in the structured information sent to OpenAI.</p>
              <p>In the current Dibs implementation, listing photo bytes are not sent to OpenAI as part of the AI request.</p>
              <p>However, if you voluntarily include personal information in the text you send to Dibs, that information may be processed by OpenAI as part of your message.</p>
              <p>Dibs does not use your conversations to train AI models.</p>
